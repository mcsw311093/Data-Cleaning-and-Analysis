This ***uncertainity of unprofitablity*** has resonated throughout the EV market and automotive market in large, which in turn made Tesla to become one of the most important benchmark indicator of the EV story (). \n",

Under the new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\\xa015, 2016; early adoption is prohibited. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application.

These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight-year life of the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information which may be available.</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">As of March\\xa031, 2015, we had deferred $43.8 million, $29.1 million, $16.7 million, and $1.2 million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access to our Supercharger network, Model S connectivity, and Autopilot software upgrades.

Under the program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we account for transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating leases. Accordingly, we defer revenue on the sale of the vehicle to deferred revenue and residual value guarantee and recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period to automotive revenue. Similarly, we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less expected salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over the same period.</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;color:#;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">At the end of the resale value guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and deferred revenue balances are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive revenue if our customer retains ownership of the car.\\xa0 In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back to us between months 36 and 39, we purchase the car in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive revenue.</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">In the fourth quarter of 2014, Tesla also began offering resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As Tesla has guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are expected to be leased to end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. As of March\\xa031, 2015 and December\\xa031, 2014, we had $76.7 million and $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantee and $17.2 million and $0 million recorded in deferred revenue liability, of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion may be distributed to the bank leasing partner should we decide to repurchase the vehicles at the end of the term or should the bank sell the car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these arrangements at March\\xa031, 2015, is $55.4 million. Cash received upon the sale of such cars is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">9</p>\\n',\n",

Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S for 36 months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term of the individual leases and record cost of automotive revenues equal to the depreciation of the leased vehicles. As of March\\xa031, 2015 and December\\xa031, 2014, we had deferred $14.8 million and $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases.

Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. The portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as current within accrued liabilities, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">10</p>\\n',\n",

Model S, including building improvements at our Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, Gigafactory construction, tooling and manufacturing equipment and capitalized interest expense. Depreciation of construction in progress begins when the assets are ready for their intended use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related assets. During the three months ended March\\xa031, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $8.3 million and $1.2 million of interest expense. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We are sometimes involved in construction at our leased facilities. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 840, <font style=\"font-style:italic;\">Leases</font>, for build-to-suit lease arrangements where we are involved in the construction of structural improvements prior to the commencement of the lease or take some level of construction risk, we are considered the owner of the assets during the construction period. Accordingly, upon commencement of our construction activities, we record a construction in progress asset and a corresponding financing liability. Once the construction is completed, if the lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease.

As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value.

secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to $100 million. Obligations under the Warehouse Facility are secured on a first priority basis by certain of our direct lease contracts and the related lease vehicles. We sell the lease contracts and related vehicles to a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an ownership interest in these assets, but not the assets themselves, to third-party lenders. Borrowings under the Warehouse Facility are generally limited to up to 72% of the present value of the remaining lease payments and the residual vehicle values under eligible lease contracts. As of March 31, 2015, we have borrowed $77 million under the Warehouse Facility.</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:4.17%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Interest is payable monthly on amounts borrowed under the Warehouse Facility at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.5%.\\xa0 The Warehouse facility matures in March 2017, at which time all outstanding borrowing will become due. Prior to that date, principal payments will be due in the amount that the borrowing limit decreases below our outstanding principal balance. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Interest Expense</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">The following table presents the aggregate amount of interest expense recognized on the warehouse line of credit, 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes relating to the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt issuance costs and debt discount. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:12pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">\\xa0</p>\\n<div>\\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;

Model S is a four door, five-passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling. Model S inherited many of the electric powertrain innovations we introduced with our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. We commenced deliveries of Model S in June 2012 and have delivered over 66,000 vehicles through March\\xa031, 2015. In 2014 we announced the availability of our All-Wheel Drive Model S and began delivery, starting with a performance-optimized version, in December 2014.

In August 2014, we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center. We are continuing to make further investment in production capacity during 2015, including building a new paint shop, a new body shop for Model X, and additional stamping capacity. We expect our annual production will increase by over 50% each year for the next several years. In addition, scaling our deliveries entails that we increase the number of customer-configured cars in-transit.\\xa0\\xa0We therefore expect production to increase faster than deliveries, resulting in higher finished goods inventory.</p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Our recent production capacity expansion contributed to average weekly production in excess of 1,000 vehicles per week during the first quarter of 2015, considering the planned shutdown of production during the first week of the year. During 2015, we plan to achieve significant efficiencies in Model S production and begin production of Model X with the intent of achieving a significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with Model S. The introduction of Model X into our existing production process will add significant complexity and may affect our ability to initially meet future efficiency and delivery targets. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">19</p>\\n',\n",

Significant cost improvements for Model S were achieved in 2014, including material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions, as well as manufacturing efficiencies. We expect that this trend will continue as we execute on our roadmap. We expect that such improvements will allow us to significantly improve our gross margin excluding the impact of foreign currency movements. During our product introductions in 2014, we incurred manufacturing inefficiencies which negatively impacted our gross margin. When we introduce Model X, we expect that both production inefficiencies and supply chain inefficiencies typical of a new product introduction will suppress Model X margins for at least a few quarters after its introduction. If we are not able to achieve the planned cost reductions from our various cost savings and process improvement initiatives or introduce Model X efficiently, our ability to reach our gross margin goals would be negatively affected. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We expect to deliver approximately 55,000 Model S and X vehicles worldwide in 2015, which is about 74% more deliveries than we achieved in 2014. To support this growth, we plan to continue to expand our Supercharger, stores and service infrastructure worldwide as well as to provide better service in areas with a high concentration of Model S customers. As we now offer Model S in many countries within North America, Europe and Asia, our expansion will primarily occur in geographic areas in which we already have a presence. Based on our current projections, we expect our long-term sales outside of North America will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue. Despite initial challenges in China, we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure in China as we believe that the country could be one of our largest markets within a few years. However, as compared to markets in the United States and Europe, we have relatively limited experience in China and other Asian markets; thus, we may face continuing difficulties meeting our future expansion plans in Asia. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:18pt;margin-left:2.27%;text-indent:0%;font-style:italic;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Trends in Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Our capital expenditures and operating expenses have significantly increased in the past year. As we continue to invest in the long term growth of Tesla, capital spending and operating expenses will continue to increase, but at a more moderate pace than in 2014.

We offer a resale value guarantee in connection with certain loans offered by financial institutions and provide this guarantee to approximately 11,760 Model S customers. We expanded this program to selected European and Asian markets this quarter. Model S deliveries with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. However, this program requires the deferral of revenues and costs into future periods under lease accounting. Although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenues and operating results in the period cars are sold under this and similar programs, as time passes, the amortization of existing deferred revenues and costs will begin to partially offset this adverse impact. Furthermore, while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, we are exposed to the risk that a vehicle’s resale value may be lower than our estimates and the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates which could adversely impact our cash flows. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">20</p>\\n',\n",

Importantly, we anticipate producing Model 3 for the mass market and thus we will need a high-volume supply of lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices. \\xa0\\xa0In addition, we have not yet finalized the design, engineering or component sourcing plans for Model 3 and there are no assurances that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently intend.

Also, if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicles, this could result in inefficient expenditures and production delays. Furthermore, to date, we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling our electric vehicles as well as limited experience allocating our available resources among the design and production of multiple vehicles, such as Model S, Model X and Model 3. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:18pt;margin-left:4.54%;text-indent:0%;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We may be unable to meet our production and delivery plans for Model S and Model X, both of which could harm our business and prospects. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:6pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Since we began manufacturing and delivering Model S in 2012, we have significantly increased production and deliveries, and our plans call for an even greater increase in production and deliveries going forward. As part of this effort, we recently completed a new final assembly line and added more automation to our body shop at the Fremont factory, are installing a highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum components and are finishing the construction of a new high volume paint shop. Our ability to further ramp-up high volume Model S production, including for the All-Wheel Drive Dual Motor Model S, which we recently began producing for the first time, and ultimately to commence and ramp production and delivery of Model X, will depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to use these new manufacturing processes as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels, our suppliers’ ability to deliver quality parts to us in a timely manner, and efficiently making design changes to ensure consistently high quality. To produce a vehicle that meets our quality standards requires us to carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees. Our suppliers also must produce new products in sufficient quantities and quality to meet our demand. Certain suppliers have experienced delays in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. Any disruption in our production of Model S and Model X in line with our plans could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">In addition, for Model S we have introduced a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry; and the Model S has a number of new and unique design features, such as a 17 inch display screen, retractable exterior door handles, and all-new dual motor and autopilot hardware, each of which poses unique manufacturing challenges. Similarly, Model X will have additional new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as those associated with the falcon-wing door, which will pose different manufacturing challenges. Production and deliveries for Model S and then Model X will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity or cause us to miss planned production targets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, sustaining high volume production and doing so in a manner that avoids significant cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, may be difficult. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production levels, we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of our vehicles. We have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles, and, in particular, to locations outside of the United States. We may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans in Asia and the right hand drive markets we have entered, which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goals. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally to match the production rate of our vehicles, this could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">28</p>\\n',\n",

Our Gigafactory plan, however, is at an early stage. While we recently entered into various formal agreements with Panasonic on the Gigafactory, we have very little experience in building a factory of the size and scope planned for the Gigafactory, and no experience directly in the production of lithium-ion cells. In addition, to date we have not finalized agreements with additional Gigafactory partners that will be co-located at the Gigafactory. Also, the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations and the Gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate. If we are unable to build the Gigafactory in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithium-ion cells at reasonable prices, then our ability to supply battery packs to our vehicles, including Model 3, according to our schedule and/or at a price that allows us to sell them profitably and in the quantities we estimate could be constrained.

For example, our vehicles are highly dependent on software to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced, and changes to software may have unexpected effects. Model S issues experienced by customers include those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our vehicles as effectively and as rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customers.\\xa0\\xa0 Any product defects or any other failure of our vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">29</p>\\n',\n",

We expect that Model X will be sourced in an approximately similar manner. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, the majority of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from single sources. To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we do not maintain long-term agreements with a number of our suppliers. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term, or at all, at prices or costs that are favorable to us. In particular, while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate sources of supply for most of our single sourced components in a relatively short time frame, qualifying alternate suppliers or developing our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our vehicles may be time consuming, costly and may force us to make additional modifications to a vehicle’s design. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">This limited supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for our vehicles, as well as for our powertrain component sales activities. For example, earthquakes similar to the one that occurred in Japan in March 2011 or labor issues such as work stoppages or strikes at the ports on the west coast could negatively impact our supply chain. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains, including those relating to our slower-than-anticipated ramp in our Model S production goals for 2012. We may experience additional delays in the future with respect to Model S, Model X and any other future vehicle we may produce. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">In addition, because we have written agreements in place with the majority, but not all, of our suppliers, this may create uncertainty regarding a supplier’s obligations to us, including but not limited to, those regarding warranty and product liability. Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significantly increased demand, or need to replace certain existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are favorable to us, at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made, and we may experience similar cost increases in the future. Additionally, we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions, seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts, and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them cheaper to produce. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs, our operating results will suffer. Additionally, cost reduction efforts may interrupt or harm our normal production processes, thereby harming vehicle quality or reducing Model S production output. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">Furthermore, a failure by our suppliers to provide the components in a timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">30</p>\\n',\n",

To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells. However, we have delivered only a limited number of our vehicles to customers and have limited field experience with them. We have also only delivered a limited number of battery packs to Daimler. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, which could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive.

While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs, we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendors could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for other automobile manufacturers until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials or prices charged to us, such as those charged by our battery cell manufacturers, would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices.

We plan to continue to sell our vehicles in company-owned Tesla stores and over the internet. While we believe our approach is important to the success of our technology and vehicles, this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We have opened Tesla stores in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific Region, many of which have been open for only a short period of time. We have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our vehicles through our Tesla stores, especially in Asia. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges. The concept and layout of our interactive stores, is different than what has previously been used in automotive sales. We do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful.

For example, we do not anticipate that we will ever carry a significant amount of vehicle inventory at our stores and customers may need to wait up to a few months from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle. This type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the United States and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such a vehicle.

The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We self-insure against the risk of product liability claims, meaning that any product liability claims will have to be paid from company funds, not by insurance. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under such a policy. </p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-indent:0%;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">35</p>\\n',\n",

These systems support our operations and enable us to produce Model S and future vehicles like Model X in volume. The implementation, maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes.

Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we currently or will sell our vehicles, such as Europe and Asia, will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles, such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers.

Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of transporting customers’ vehicles to our nearest Tesla service center would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. Further, certain state franchise laws which prohibit manufacturers from being licensed as a dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturers from providing vehicle service.

To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand.

When Tesla purchased the property, the previous owner and operator of the Tesla Factory, New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.

Although NUMMI stated that it fully documented and managed all environmental issues at the Tesla Factory, we cannot determine with certainty the truth of this statement, nor the total costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination that may eventually be found. We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions (Remediation Activities), and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such Remediation Activities.

As a result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities are applying their state laws to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict.

For example, vehicle dealer associations in New York, Ohio and Massachusetts have filed lawsuits to revoke dealer licenses issued to us. These lawsuits have been dismissed, and in one recent court decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that state franchise laws like the one in Massachusetts do not restrict a manufacturer, like Tesla, that does not use franchised dealers from selling its vehicles directly to consumers. Such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. Similar lawsuits have been filed in Georgia and Missouri. Possible additional challenges in other states, if successful, could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. Such events recently occurred in New Jersey, where the Motor Vehicle Commission, at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby, passed a new regulation which purported to invalidate our sales licenses in the state, and in Michigan, where the state’s automobile dealer association managed to add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicles through Tesla stores in Michigan. The law in New Jersey has subsequently been clarified to permit our operations, and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solutions to remedy the situation in Michigan. Other states, such as New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. </p>\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12pt;text-indent:4.54%;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;\">We are also registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in Canada, Australia, and Japan, and have obtained licenses to sell vehicles in other places such as Hong Kong and China. Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices.
